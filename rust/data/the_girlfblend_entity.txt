hey fren, pls can you write me a real sinister horror story based on a guy using a piece of code called 'girlfblend', which mixes two images together to make a composite person - but when a slim, pale colour picture of a texan girl in full colour is entered along with a yong extrordinairily clean shaven delicate featured young australian guy, the output image is as the attachment. when repeated, each time out comes the same old black and white image guy, thouggh with subtle differences in hair or expression etc. the texan girl flees her computer in terror as her coder image blending fren calls her a 'haunted ass bitch' - but the story spirals worse as the man in the image begins to terrorise first her sleeping then waking moments...


"The Girlfblend Entity"
"Hey, fren, try running the code with a picture of yourself and that one pic of you at the rodeo," Logan typed out casually over Discord. Megan furrowed her brow at the screen, adjusting the Texan hat sitting proudly on her dresser in the background. She looked at the code again — simple enough in theory. The program, Girlfblend, was designed to take two images, find their most defining features, and blend them into a new composite person. It was a fun project, an experiment to see if AI could predict what "offspring" might look like, but every coder knew that such outputs were chaotic, unpredictable...or at least they were supposed to be.

"Y'all're such a nerd," she shot back, smirking as she selected her image from the summer before. Sun-soaked hair, clear green eyes, and that flash of white teeth in a mischievous grin — full of life and youth. She paired it with a headshot of Logan from his university days in Sydney. He looked like a Hollywood heartthrob, too clean, too perfect, with high cheekbones and a delicate, handsome jawline.

"Ready?" she typed, fingers drumming nervously. Logan sent a thumbs-up emoji in response.

Megan clicked Run.

The screen flickered. The processing bar shot up, halted, then stuttered erratically. And then, with a beep, an image materialized.

It wasn’t the mix of the two vibrant, youthful faces she’d expected. Her breath hitched in her throat. Instead of some youthful hybrid... there was a face staring back at her, gaunt and ghostly, like something wrenched out of the past — the face of a man who had seen too much, a visage hardened by time and loss.

An old man.

His hair was wild, gray and curly around his forehead, and his eyes... his eyes were deep, haunted pits, hollow as if gazing into the abyss itself. There was a strange, oppressive weight in his gaze, a pressure she could almost feel through the screen. And worst of all, the image was a black-and-white photo, tinged in sepia, like a relic of some long-forgotten era.

"What... the hell?" she muttered, leaning back in her chair, pushing herself away from the monitor. She shot Logan a message immediately: "Is this some kinda joke?"

"What d’you mean?" he responded after a moment. The typing bubble appeared and disappeared repeatedly as he fumbled with his words. "Show me?"

Megan dragged the image into the chat window, waiting as it sent. Logan’s silence was long, almost unbearable. When he finally responded, it was just one line:

"Haunted ass bitch."

"Excuse me?!"

"No, no, not you!" he replied quickly. "The picture! I mean, look at it! That’s... that’s not a normal blend, Meg."

She tried to shake off the creeping sense of dread, forcing herself to laugh it off. "I’ll just run it again. It’s probably a bug."

Another click. Another Run. Another beep.

The same face stared back at her. This time his expression was subtly different, lips curled in what might have been a sneer, eyes just a shade more intense.

Megan felt a chill crawl up her spine. Sweat beaded at her temples. "What is this?" she whispered. Her hand trembled as she minimized the window. She hovered over the program icon — Girlfblend.exe — ready to delete it, but something stopped her. Curiosity? Madness? She didn’t know.

“Third time’s the charm…” she breathed, and hit Run once more.

The beep seemed louder this time, almost aggressive.

The face had changed again.

Now, the old man looked amused. No, mocking. A curl of lip, a narrowing of the eyes, a subtle shift that was somehow all the more disturbing for its subtleness. His face had almost come to life.

Her heart hammered in her chest. She tried to shake off the sensation, the prickling paranoia. It’s just code. Just pixels on a screen.

But the image was burned into her mind, lingering even when she closed the program and pushed away from her desk. She could see his eyes still, sharp and cold, boring into her.

Sleep didn’t come easily that night. When she did finally drift off, she found herself standing in the same shadowy room. The walls melted and warped in the dreamscape, twisting around her. And there, in the corner, the man stood.

“Stop,” she gasped. But he didn’t move. He just stared, those dark pits of eyes unblinking, his lips twitching into that same cruel sneer.

She awoke with a start, gasping, drenched in sweat.

“Just a nightmare,” she murmured to herself, shaking. “Just a damn nightmare.”

But the nightmares didn’t stop.

Every night, his presence grew stronger, more tangible. The images she’d run during the day started to blur with the nightmares at night, until she could almost hear him whispering to her in a low, grating voice, taunting her, cursing her.

She uninstalled the program, deleted the files, and even wiped her hard drive.

But it didn’t matter.

He was there every time she blinked, etched into her vision. The deep lines of his face. The wild curls. The intensity of his gaze.

Megan stopped sleeping altogether, pacing her apartment in a state of near-delirium, fingers twitching from lack of rest. She would see him — just a flash — in the bathroom mirror. In the blackened screen of her phone. Reflected in the windows of her apartment. Always watching.

And then, one night, as she stumbled through the darkened hallway of her home, she saw him standing there. Real. Tangible.

“Wh-what are you?” she whimpered, clutching the wall for support.

His smile widened, cracking the aged skin around his mouth. “You shouldn’t have tried to blend what was never meant to be blended, Megan.”

She froze. “How do you—”

But his laugh — a dry, raspy sound like the shifting of dead leaves — cut her off. “You let me in,” he whispered. “And now, you can’t get me out.”

She screamed, backing away, scrambling for the door. But no matter where she turned, no matter how fast she ran, he was always there. His face warped and twisted in the shadows. Eyes burning holes into her soul.

She fled the apartment that night, leaving everything behind — her computer, her work, her life. She took the first bus out of town, her hands shaking, eyes wide and bloodshot.

Logan’s messages sat unanswered on her phone. Megan? Meg, are you okay? Why did you send me that weird old man pic?

But it was the final message that chilled her to the bone:

“He’s here, too.”

She dropped the phone, trembling. And from the screen, the old man’s image flickered, just for a moment. Just a moment — but his eyes met hers, a look of triumph flickering in their depths.

And then the screen went black.

Wherever Megan fled, it didn’t matter. Every screen, every reflective surface... she saw him. Staring. Waiting.

She’d let him into the code.

And now, he was free.

i have an idea fren - lets change the ending by extending it so he gets closer n closer to megan, increasingly adding to the description making him more terrifying by adding detail about his one wild eyebrow, weird hair growths, and ultimately the hair sprouting from his actual eye - try finding a way for her to have some kind of countdown such that it builds tension to a horrific jump scare climax with unthinkable outcome suggested...

"The Girlfblend Entity"
“Why won’t you leave me alone?” Megan whimpered, curled up in the corner of her motel room. Days had passed, or maybe weeks. She didn’t know anymore. Time had blurred into a haze of dread, sleeplessness, and that face — his face — leering at her from every screen, every shadow. No matter how far she ran, no matter how many towns she skipped, the old man was always there.

He was different each time. Not just in the subtle smirk or the tilt of his head, but in ways that were harder to explain. His hair seemed to grow in unnatural ways — not just longer but wilder, thicker, like it was crawling down his neck in a creeping, unnatural way. And his brow… One eyebrow had grown into a jagged, monstrous arc, sprouting like a gnarled root above his hollow eyes, almost touching his temple.

Each time she saw him, there was more. It was as if the image itself was alive, twisting and contorting in response to her terror.

Four more nights.

That’s what the shadow in her nightmares had whispered to her, raspy and mocking. “Four more nights,” it had breathed into her ear, its putrid breath hot against her neck. The countdown had begun. Each night since, his presence had grown stronger, closer. His features sharper, his gaze more knowing.

Three more nights.

The old man’s nose, once just a vague blur of shadow and light, now appeared twisted and malformed. Thick tufts of wiry hair erupted from his nostrils like some invasive weed, coiling outward, reaching almost up to his eyes — those eyes that no longer fit his face.

And that smile.

It was stretching wider.

Wider.

Every time she blinked, it grew. And he grew with it.

Two more nights.

By now, Megan could barely breathe without feeling his presence suffocating her. His features had become grotesque, distorted. The jagged eyebrow had thickened to the size of a small tree root, curling in on itself and twisting around his eye socket. But that wasn’t the worst part.

Hair — coarse, dark, oily hair — had begun to grow from the very surface of his eye, writhing out of his iris like black worms pushing through decaying soil. She could almost see it pulsing, twitching with every blink. She screamed at the sight, but no one could hear her anymore. Not here. Not in this nowhere-town with its empty motel rooms and humming neon lights.

He was watching her from everywhere. Always with that malevolent grin, lips splitting wider, skin cracking with every expansion. Like he was barely holding himself together.

One more night.

The dreams had grown too real now. She could feel him leaning closer, his breath tickling her ear as he whispered that single number, his voice vibrating through her very bones.

“One…”

Megan had left the motel that morning, clutching her phone as though it could protect her. She’d run, trying to flee, but every corner she turned, every alley she ducked into, his face was there. On a flickering TV through a shop window. Reflected in the dark puddles beneath her feet. Even in the gleaming chrome of a parked car’s bumper — his leering, broken grin stretched across its surface.

And the hair. Oh god, the hair. It had spread, not just on his face now but across his entire head in thick, uneven patches. It jutted out in sharp, jagged angles — tufts of it erupting from his cheeks, his lips, his very eyes. Eyes that were bleeding, tearing apart as the black tendrils of hair pushed through the sclera, the veins snapping like rubber bands beneath the pressure.

“Just one more,” he rasped through that twisted smile, voice low and guttural. The words reverberated through her head, bouncing off the walls of her skull.

Megan stumbled, clutching at her temples, gasping as she realized:

He was getting closer.

Tonight.

The countdown ended.

The face was no longer confined to screens or reflections. He was standing right there, in the corner of her tiny room. Real. Tangible. But not whole. His outline flickered in and out of focus, like an image half-loaded, pixels shimmering at the edges of reality. She watched, paralyzed, as his form solidified. The hair sprouting from his eyes twisted violently, curling and uncurling like living snakes. His jagged eyebrow seemed to scrape the very air, tendrils clawing their way across his temple, embedding into his skull.

And then he moved.

One lurching step forward.

Megan couldn’t breathe. Couldn’t move.

The man loomed over her, his body bending impossibly close, that hideous face filling her vision.

“I’m here,” he whispered, and the sound was like glass grinding against her spine.

She gasped, stumbling back, her body hitting the wall. Her phone slipped from her hand, the screen flickering to life as it hit the floor.

He moved closer still, his face inches from hers, the hairs from his eyes brushing against her cheek. She could feel them, could feel the wetness of his breath, the twitch of those writhing black strands as they brushed against her skin, leaving thin trails of something sticky and cold.

“I’m real now,” he breathed. His lips — cracked and bleeding — split even wider, the flesh tearing as he grinned.

And then, with a sharp, violent twitch, he lunged.

A scream tore from Megan’s throat, but it was drowned out by the blaring alarm from her phone, the shrill sound cutting through the room like a knife.

12:00 AM.

She flailed, grabbing blindly for the phone. The screen glowed in the darkness, the old man’s twisted image staring up at her, frozen in that last horrific grin.

But… something was wrong.

He wasn’t looking at her.

He was looking behind her.

A cold, heavy weight settled in Megan’s stomach as she slowly turned, her breath hitching in her throat. And there, standing in the dimly lit corner of the room…

The old man stared back, no longer a flicker, no longer an image.

Fully real.

The hair was everywhere now — thick, greasy strands sprouting from every inch of his face, his eyes, his tongue. The tendrils twitched and writhed, his body convulsing as they spread further, spilling onto the floor, creeping toward her.

“Welcome… to your new home,” he rasped, his voice distorted, a guttural gurgle as the hair pushed out of his throat, choking the words.

And then, with a final, convulsive snap, he lunged.

The phone’s screen shattered beneath Megan’s hand as the room erupted in darkness.

And somewhere, in the suffocating void, a voice whispered:

“Zero.”
